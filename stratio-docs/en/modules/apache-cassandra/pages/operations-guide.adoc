== Description

The SSCC Apache Cassandra® connector allows you to integrate Apache Cassandra® into _Stratio Generative AI Data Fabric_.

Both the supported features and the different versions are found in the xref:apache-cassandra:compatibility-matrix.adoc[compatibility matrix].

=== Authentication

Currently, the connector only supports *username and password* authentication.

== Prerequisites

* Install the xref:connectors-repository:operations-guide.adoc#_install[connectors repository].
+
IMPORTANT: In the connectors repository, the `sscc-cassandra-0.3_2.12-1.3.x artifact, which will be used for a basic use of the SSCC Apache Cassandra® connector, will be available at the URL `http://connectors.<tenant>-<namespace>/v1/api/artifact/<artifact_name>`.

* Have the xref:ROOT:quick-start-guide.adoc[_Stratio KMS_ UI] accessible.
* Have an instance of an Apache Cassandra® database installed and accessible from _Stratio Generative AI Data Fabric_.
* Have a user to the Apache Cassandra® database installed with the following basic permissions:
** Privileges
- CREATE
- DESCRIBE
- SELECT
- MODIFY
- ALTER
** Name of the resource(s)
- KEYSPACE `<keyspace-name>`. Name of the _keyspace_ or _keyspaces_ to be discovered.
- TABLE `<table-name>`. Name of the table or tables to be discovered.

* Create the secrets in _Stratio KMS_. Currently, the connector only supports username and password authentication.
+
--
The secret to be uploaded consists of two keys:

* _user_ : `<cassandra_user>`.
* _pass_ : `<cassandra_password>`.
--
+
There will be an image similar to this:
+
image::cassandra-vault-discovery-agent-user-pass.png[]
+
This secret should be uploaded to the following _Stratio KMS_ directories:
+
** *Discovery agent*: `userland/passwords/<agent_name>/<secret_name>`.
** *_Stratio Virtualizer_*: `userland/passwords/<virtualizer_name>.<namespace_virtualizer>/<secret_name>`.
** *_Stratio Rocket_*: `userland/passwords/<rocket_name>.<namespace_rocket>/<secret_name>`.
** *_Stratio Rocket_ _workflows_*: `userland/passwords/execution-identity-<rocket_name>.<namespace_rocket>/<secret_name>`.
** *_Stratio Intelligence_*: `/people/passwords/<intelligence_user_name>/<secret_name>`.

== Discover your data

=== Discovery agent

To install a _Stratio Data Governance_ discovery agent for Apache Cassandra® you must go to '_Stratio Command Center_' -> 'Deploy a Service' -> 'Connectors RDBMS' and select "Apache Cassandra Agent".

The fields to be filled in for the installation are:

* *_General_*:
** * *_Service ID_*: agent's unique identifier. Example: _/dg-agent-cassandra-test_.
** *_Name of the Service_*: name displayed in _Stratio KEOS_. Example: _/dg-agent-cassandra-test_.
* *_Metadata Data store (PostgreSQL®)_*.
** * *_Host_*: the PostgreSQL® instance that stores the discovered metadata. Example: _pgbouncer-postgreskeos-governance.keos-core_.
* *_Configuration of the service to be discovered_*
** *_Service to be discovered_*
*** *_Service name_*: name that will be used to identify this data store in _Stratio Data Governance_. It's the one that will be displayed in its UI. Example: _dg-agent-cassandra-test_.
*** *_Root discovery path_*: schema over which you want to discover the metadata recursively. In the case of Apache Cassandra®, these are the different _keyspaces_ you want to govern. Example: _/exampleconnector,/example2connector_.
** *_Resource data store connection configuration_*
*** *_Custom Service URL_*: URL where the Apache Cassandra® instance is hosted. Example: _dbsqa.labs.stratio.com:9043_.
*** *_Custom data store service security_*: authentication method for the Apache Cassandra® instance. Example: MD5.
*** *_Access credentials_*: name of the _stratiocredentials_ or _Stratio KMS_ path with the authorization credentials. Example: _cassandra-secrets_.
* *_SSCC driver location_*: URL where the artifact that will contain the JAR of the SSCC Apache Cassandra® connector is located in the connectors repository. Example: `http://connectors.<tenant>-<namespace>/v1/api/artifact/sscc-cassandra-0.3_2.12-1.3.x.jar`.

You should be left with a configuration similar to the following image:

image::cassandra-discovery-agent-settings.png[width=80%]

The discovery process is asynchronous. Once the discovery is finished you can view it from the _Stratio Data Governance_ UI.

image::cassandra-governance-tabla.png[]

NOTE: Views in Apache Cassandra® are supported but are displayed as tables in the _Stratio Data Governance_ UI.

== Virtualize your data

IMPORTANT: Note that, to virtualize the discovered tables, you need to manage the xref:stratio-gosec:operations-manual:data-access/manage-policies/manage-domains-policies.adoc[domain policies] through _Stratio GoSec_.

=== Eureka agent

To use the BDL, you need to configure the Eureka agent with the SSCC Apache Cassandra® connector. To do this, just add the URL of the connectors repository of the `sscc-cassandra-0.3_2.12-1.3.x` artifact in the variable 'Customized deployment' -> 'Settings' -> `Additional jars`.

You should be left with a configuration similar to this:

* _Additional jars_: *http://connectors.<tenant>-<namespace>/v1/api/api/artifact/sscc-cassandra-0.3_2.12-1.3.x.jar*.

As shown in the following image:

image::cassandra-eureka-environment.png[]

NOTE: Remember that, if you already have more than one artifact in the list, you have to add the following ones, separating them with a comma.

TIP: See here for xref:stratio-data-governance:user-manual:data-processing-with-bdl.adoc[more information about data processing with BDL].

=== _Stratio Virtualizer_

_Stratio Virtualizer_ supports interaction with Apache Cassandra® through the SSCC Apache Cassandra® connector. This integration has certain requirements:

* The following _Stratio Virtualizer_ deployment fields must be modified in _Stratio Command Center_:
** 'Customized deployment' -> 'Environment' -> 'External datastores' -> 'JDBC Integration'.
*** *_JDBC Integration_*: `True`.
** 'Customized deployment' -> 'Environment' -> 'External datastores' -> 'JDBC Drivers URL List'.
*** *_JDBC Drivers URL List_*: `http://connectors.<tenant>-<namespace>/v1/api/artifact/sscc-cassandra-0.3_2.12-1.1.0.jar`.

You should be left with a configuration similar to this:

image::cassandra-virtualizer-environment.png[]

NOTE: Remember that, if you already have more than one artifact in the list, you have to add the following ones, separating them with a comma.

== Transform your data

=== _Stratio Rocket_

==== Managing the driver

To use _Stratio Rocket_, the SSCC Apache Cassandra® connector needs to be configured. To do this:

* You have to add the URL of the `sscc-cassandra-0.3_2.12-1.3.x` artifact in the 'Customized deployment' -> 'Settings' -> 'Classpath' -> `Rocket extra jars` variable of _Stratio Command Center_.
** *_Rocket extra jars_*: `http://connectors.<tenant>-<namespace>/v1/api/artifact/sscc-cassandra-0.3_2.12-1.1.0.jar`.

As shown in the following image:

image::cassandra-rocket-environment.png[]

==== Managing secrets

Upload the access credentials for the _workflows_ and for _Stratio Rocket_ to _Stratio KMS_ as described in the prerequisites.

[#rocket-configuration]

==== Configuration management: quality rules and lineage

Go to the _Stratio Rocket_ configuration in 'Settings' -> 'Governance Lineage' and make sure that the "Governance Lineage" option is enabled.

The fields to be filled in are the following:

* _Custom lineage and quality rules methods using Spark format_: `com.stratio.connectors.apache-cassandra:com.stratio.connectors.sscccassandra.CassandraQualityRulesAndLineage:getMetadataPath`.
** This option activates lineage for data flows using _datasource_ boxes that access the data store directly.
+
IMPORTANT: For lineage to work properly, the discovery agent must have the value `<host_url_cassandra>.port.<port_url_cassandra>` as its _Service Name_.
+
* _Custom planned quality rules methods_: `com.stratio.connectors.sscccassandra.CassandraDriverMD5:com.stratio.connectors.sscccassandra.CassandraQualityRulesAndLineage:getPlannedQRCreateTable`.
** With this option, the planned quality rules that directly access tables in the data store will be supported.

NOTE: Remember that, if you already have more than one artifact in the list, you have to add the following ones, separating them with a comma.

Restart _Stratio Rocket_ to apply the changes.

NOTE: These variables are *not necessary* for lineage and quality rules on virtualized tables in the catalog.

=== _Stratio Intelligence_

To correctly configure _Stratio Intelligence_, see the xref:apache-cassandra:quick-start-guide.adoc#_stratio_intelligence[_Stratio Intelligence_ section]. For integration with Apache Cassandra®, only the credentials shown in the prerequisites need to be uploaded.
