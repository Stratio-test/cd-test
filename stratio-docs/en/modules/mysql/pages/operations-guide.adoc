= Operations guide

== Description

The SSCC MySQL connector will allow you to integrate MySQL in _Stratio Generative AI Data Fabric_.

It also allows connection to the MariaDB data store, which is a derivative of MySQL. To connect to MariaDB you can follow this guide, but keep in mind that *MySQL is the name used in it*.

Both the supported features and the different versions are found in the xref:mysql:compatibility-matrix.adoc[compatibility matrix].

=== Authentication

Currently, the connector only supports username and password authentication.

== Prerequisites

. Install the xref:connectors-repository:operations-guide.adoc#_installation[connectors repository].
+
IMPORTANT: In the connectors repository, the `sscc-mysql-0.3_2.12-3.1.x` artifact, which will be used for basic use of the MySQL connector, will be available at the URL `http://connectors.tenant-my_namespace/v1/api/artifact/<artifact_name>`. You need to upload the JDBC driver artifact indicated in the compatibility matrix to the connectors repository, because this driver isn't included in the repository by default.

. The xref:ROOT:quick-start-guide.adoc[_Stratio KMS_ UI] should be accessible to manage credentials:
. Have an instance of a MySQL database accessible from the _Stratio Generative AI Data Fabric_ with the chosen authentication mode configured:
. Create secrets in _Stratio KMS_. Currently, the connector only supports username and password authentication.
+
--
The secret to be uploaded consists of two keys:

** _user_ : <mysql_user>.
** _pass_ : <mysql_pass>.
--
+
This secret must be uploaded to the following _Stratio KMS_ directories:

** *Discovery agent*: `userland/passwords/<agent_name>/<secret_name>`.
** *_Stratio Virtualizer_*: `userland/passwords/<virtualizer_name>.<virtualizer_namespace>/<secret_name>`.
** *_Stratio Rocket_*: `userland/passwords/<rocket_name>.<rocket_namespace>/<secret_name>`.
** *_Stratio Rocket_ workflows*: `userland/passwords/execution-identity-<rocket_name>.<rocket_namespace>/<secret_name>`.
** *_Stratio Intelligence_*: `/people/passwords/<intelligence_user_name>/<secret_name>`.

== Discover your data

=== Discovery agent

To install a _Stratio Data Governance_ discovery agent for MySQL you must select "MySQL Agent" in '_Stratio Command Center_' -> 'Deploy a Service' -> 'Connectors RDBMS'.

The fields to be filled in for the installation are:

* *_General_*
** *_Service ID_*: agent's unique identifier.
** *_Name of the Service_*: name shown in DC/OS or K8s.
* *_Metadata Data store (PostgreSQL®)_*
** *_Host_*: the PostgreSQL® instance that stores the discovered metadata. For example: _poolpostgresgov_.
* *_Configuration of the service to be discovered_*
** *_Service to be discovered_*
*** *_Service name_*: name that will be used to identify this data store in _Stratio Data Governance_. This name will be displayed in the _Stratio Data Governance_ UI.
*** *_Root discovery path_*: path from which you want to discover the metadata recursively.
+

** *Resource datastore connection configuration*
*** *_Custom Service URL_*: JDBC URL of the MySQL instance including the placeholder `-db-`. For example: `jdbc:mysql://mysql.tenant-namespace:3306/-db-`.
*** *_Custom data store service security_*: only supports username and password (MD5).
*** *_Access credentials_*: name of the secret in Vault with authorization credentials, e.g.: _mysql-connectors_.
*** *_SSCC driver location_*: URL where the artifact that will contain the JAR of the SSCC MySQL connector is located in the connectors repository. Example: _http://connectors.<tenant>-<namespace>/v1/api/artifact/sscc-mysql-0.3_2.12-3.1.x.jar_.
*** *_JDBC driver location_*: URL where the artifact that will contain the JAR of the selected JDBC driver is located in the connectors repository. Example: _http://connectors.<tenant>-<namespace>/v1/api/artifact/mysql-jdbc-x.x.x.jar`_.
*** *_MySQL JDBC version_*: JDBC version used to connect to MySQL. Use 5.1.42 for MySQL server < 5.7, or 8.0.30 for newer versions.
+

The discovery process is asynchronous. Once completed, it can be viewed from the _Stratio Data Governance_ UI.

== Virtualize your data

IMPORTANT: Note that to virtualize the discovered tables, you need to manage the xref:stratio-gosec:operations-manual:data-access/manage-policies/manage-domains-policies.adoc[domain policies] through _Stratio GoSec_.

=== Eureka agent

To use the BDL, you need to configure the Eureka agent with the MySQL connector. To do this, simply add the URL of the connectors repository of the `sscc-mysql-0.3_2.12-3.1.x` artifact in the 'Customized deployment' -> 'Settings' -> `Additional jars` variable.

image::mysql-bdl.png[]

NOTE: Remember that, if you already have more than one artifact in the list, you have to add the following ones, separating them with a comma.

TIP: See here for xref:stratio-data-governance:user-manual:data-processing-with-bdl.adoc[more information about data processing with BDL].

=== _Stratio Virtualizer_

_Stratio Virtualizer_ supports interaction with MySQL through the SSCC MySQL connector. This integration has certain requirements:

* The following _Stratio Virtualizer_ deployment fields must be modified in _Stratio Command Center_:
+
--
** 'Customized deployment' -> 'Environment' -> 'External datastores' -> 'JDBC Integration'.
*** *_JDBC Integration_*: `True`.
** 'Customized deployment' -> 'Environment' -> 'External datastores' -> 'JDBC Drivers URL List'.
*** *_JDBC Drivers URL List_*: `http://connectors.<tenant>-<namespace>/v1/api/artifact/sscc-mysql-0.3_2.12-3.1.x.jar,http://connectors.<tenant>-<namespace>/v1/api/artifact/mysql-jdbc-x.x.x.jar`.
--

== Transform your data

=== _Stratio Rocket_

==== Managing the driver

To use _Stratio Rocket_, the MySQL connector needs to be configured. To do this:

* You have to add the URL of the `sscc-mysql-0.3_2.12-3.1.x` and `mysql-jdbc-x.x.x` artifacts in the 'Customized deployment' -> 'Settings' -> 'Classpath' -> `Rocket extra jars` variable of _Stratio Command Center_.

** *_Rocket extra jars_*: `http://connectors.<tenant>-<namespace>/v1/api/artifact/sscc-mysql-0.3_2.12-3.1.x.jar,http://connectors.<tenant>-<namespace>/v1/api/artifact/mysql-jdbc-x.x.x.jar`.
+
image::mysql-rocket-conf.png[]

* You also have to upload the access credentials for workflows and for _Stratio Rocket_ to _Stratio KMS_.

==== Managing secrets

Upload the access credentials for the workflows and for _Stratio Rocket_ to _Stratio KMS_ as described in the prerequisites.

[#rocket-configuration]

==== Configuration management: quality rules and lineage

Go to the _Stratio Rocket_ configuration in 'Settings' -> 'Governance Lineage' and make sure that the "Governance Lineage" option is activated.

The fields to be filled in are the following:

* _Custom lineage and quality rules methods using JDBC driver_: `com.mysql8030.cj.jdbc.Driver:com.stratio.connectors.ssccmysql.MySqlDriverQualityRulesAndLineage:getMetadataPath`.
** This option activates lineage for data flows using _datasource_ boxes that access the data store directly.
+
IMPORTANT: For lineage to work properly, the discovery agent must have the value `<host_url_jdbc_mysql>.port.<port_url_jdbc_mysql>` as its _Service Name_.
+
* _Custom planned quality rules methods_: `com.stratio.connectors.ssccmysql.MySqlDriver:com.stratio.connectors.ssccmysql.MySqlQualityRulesAndLineage:getPlannedQRCreateTable`.
** With this option, the planned quality rules that directly access tables in the data store will be supported.

NOTE: Remember, if you already have more than one reference isn the list, you need to add the following ones, separated by a comma.

Restart _Stratio Rocket_ to apply the changes.

NOTE: These variables are *not necessary* for the lineage and quality rules on virtualized tables in the catalog.

=== _Stratio Intelligence_

To correctly configure _Stratio Intelligence_, see the xref:mysql:quick-start-guide.adoc#_stratio_intelligence[_Stratio Intelligence_ section]. For integration with MySQL, you only need to upload the credentials shown in the prerequisites.
