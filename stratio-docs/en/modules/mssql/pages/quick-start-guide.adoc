= Quick start guide

The purpose of this guide is to briefly explain how to integrate a Microsoft SQL Server database into the _Stratio Generative AI Data Fabric_ platform.

== Prerequisites

You can find the prerequisites for installing the Microsoft SQL Server connector in the xref:mssql:operations-guide.adoc#_prerequisites[operations guide].

NOTE: Please note that the *Kerberos authentication mode* will be used in this quick start guide.

== Discover your data

=== Discovery agent

To install a _Stratio Data Governance_ discovery agent for Microsoft SQL Server, in '_Stratio Command Center_' -> 'Deploy a Service' -> 'Connectors RDBMS', select "Microsoft SQLServer Agent".

When installing, you have to add the information corresponding to the database instance to be discovered, in addition to the URLs of the connectors repository where the necessary artifacts are stored and xref:mssql:operations-guide.adoc#create-secret[upload the access credentials to _Stratio KMS_].

The most important fields to fill in are:

* *_Root discovery path_*: Microsoft SQL Server schemas that you want to be discovered. They must be separated by commas, without spaces, and with a `/` slash at the beginning.
* *_Custom Service URL_*: JDBC URL used to connect to Microsoft SQL Server. Example: `jdbc:sqlserver://mssql.stratio.com:1434/-db-`.
* *_Access credentials_*: name of the secret created in xref:#create-secret[_Stratio KMS_]. Example: `mssql-secret`.
* *_SSCC driver location_*: URL where the artifact that will contain the JAR of the SSCC Microsoft SQL Server connector is located in the connectors repository. Example: `http://connectors.<tenant>-<namespace>/v1/api/artifact/sscc-mssql-0.3_2.12-1.5.x.jar`.
* *_JDBC driver location_*: URL where the artifact that will contain the JAR of the selected JDBC driver is located in the connectors repository. Example: `http://connectors.<tenant>-<namespace>/v1/api/artifact/mssql-jdbc-9.4.1.jre8.jar`.

TIP: More information on the other configuration parameters can be found in the xref:mssql:operations-guide.adoc[operations guide].

Once the discovery process is completed, the data store will appear in the _Stratio Data Governance_ UI.

== Virtualize your data

=== Eureka agent

To use the BDL, you need to configure the Eureka agent with the Microsoft SQL Server connector. To do this, simply add the URL of the connectors repository of the `sscc-sscc-0.3_2.12-1.3.x` artifact in the 'Customized deployment' -> 'Settings' -> `Additional jars` variable.

* *_Additional jars_*: `http://connectors.<tenant>-<namespace>/v1/api/artifact/sscc-mssql-0.3_2.12-1.5.x.jar`.

NOTE: Remember that, if you already have more than one artifact in the list, you have to add the following ones, separating them with a comma.

=== _Stratio Virtualizer_

To use _Stratio Virtualizer_, the Microsoft SQL Server connector needs to be configured. To do so, you need to add the URL of the `sscc-mssql-0.3_2.12-1.5.x` artifact in the 'Customized deployment' -> 'Environment' -> 'External datastores' -> `JDBC Drivers URL List` variable and also upload the access credentials to _Stratio KMS_.

* *_JDBC Drivers URL List_*: `http://connectors.<tenant>-<namespace>/v1/api/artifact/mssql-jdbc-9.4.1.jre8.jar,http://connectors.<tenant>-<namespace>/v1/api/artifact/sscc-mssql-0.3_2.12-1.5.x.jar`.

== Transform your data

=== _Stratio Rocket_

To use _Stratio Rocket_, the Microsoft SQL Server connector needs to be configured. To do this, you must add the URL of the `sscc-mssql-0.3_2.12-1.5.x` artifact in the 'Customized deployment' -> 'Settings' -> 'Classpath' -> `Rocket extra jars` variable and also upload the access credentials for workflows and for _Stratio Rocket_ to _Stratio KMS_.

In the example being followed, _Stratio Rocket_ would look like this:

* *_Rocket extra jars_*: `http://connectors.<tenant>-<namespace>/v1/api/artifact/mssql-jdbc-9.4.1.jre8.jar,http://connectors.<tenant>-<namespace>/v1/api/artifact/sscc-mssql-0.3_2.12-1.5.x.jar`.

After applying these changes, you should be able to access the virtualized Microsoft SQL Server collection via SQL queries directly in the catalog or via a _Stratio Virtualizer_ input in a workflow.

TIP: More information on the other configuration parameters can be found in the xref:mssql:operations-guide.adoc#rocket-configuration[operations guide].

=== _Stratio Intelligence_

You'll need to configure _Stratio Intelligence_ as described in the xref:ROOT:quick-start-guide.adoc#_stratio_intelligence[general quick start guide] before integrating with the connector.

Once you've configured _Stratio Intelligence_, you have to add the Microsoft SQL Server connector and JDBC driver to the _artifacts/spark++_++jars_ directory and xref:mssql:operations-guide.adoc[upload the access credentials to _Stratio KMS_].

To upload the artifact, you have to download it to the _artifacts/spark++_++jars_ directory in the _Stratio Intelligence_ workspace by issuing a cURL request. In this case, you could make the following request:

[source,bash]
----
curl http://connectors.<tenant>-<namespace>/v1/api/artifact/sscc-mssql-0.3_2.12-1.5.x.jar --output sscc-mssql-0.3_2.12-1.5.x.jar
curl http://connectors.<tenant>-<namespace>/v1/api/artifact/mssql-jdbc-9.4.1.jre8.jar --output mssql-jdbc-9.4.1.jar
----

Once this configuration is done, you'll be able to access the tables that have been virtualized from the external Microsoft SQL Server database.
