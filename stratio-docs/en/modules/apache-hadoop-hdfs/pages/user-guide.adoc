== Description

The Apache Hadoop® (HDFS) connector allows you to fully integrate Apache Hadoop® (HDFS) into _Stratio Generative AI Data Fabric_.

Both the supported features and the different versions are found in the xref:apache-hadoop-hdfs:compatibility-matrix.adoc[compatibility matrix].

== Discover your data

=== Know your data

In addition to what xref:stratio-data-governance:user-manual:from-a-data-store-to-a-dictionary.adoc#_tables_and_columns[__Stratio Data Governance__] shows, you can also find technical attributes extracted from Apache Hadoop® (HDFS) resources. All metadata provided by Apache Hadoop® (HDFS) is extracted and added to the _Stratio Data Governance_ UI in both tables and columns.

* The metadata extracted in table are: _owner_, _group_, _permissions_, _isEncrypted_, _length_, _replication_, _blockSize_, _modifiedAt_, _schema_ and _partition_.

* The metadata extracted in column are: _schemaType_, _type_, _default_, _constraint_, _ordinal_, _properties_, _excelProperties_.

=== BDL virtualization

The discovery process is asynchronous. Once completed, it can be viewed from the _Stratio Data Governance_ UI.

The connector supports customization of data access in virtualized tables using xref:stratio-data-governance:user-manual:bdl-virtualization.adoc#_bdl_custom_attributes[advanced BDL attributes] from _Stratio Data Governance_. These can be modified from the UI. 

TIP: You can consult how to create attributes in the xref:stratio-data-governance:user-manual:addition-of-metadata[_Stratio Data Governance_ user guide].

TIP: For more details on the use of the BDL, see the xref:stratio-data-governance:user-manual:data-processing-with-bdl.adoc[BDL data processing documentation].

== Virtualize your data

After tables have been discovered, you can add them to a technical view of a collection. All the configurable parameters of the discovery and those parameters modified from the _Stratio Data Governance_ UI are propagated in the collections where that table is added.

TIP: To learn more about how to manage collections you can consult the xref:stratio-data-governance:user-manual:collections.adoc[_Stratio Data Governance_ user guide].

IMPORTANT: Note that to virtualize the discovered tables, you need to manage the xref:stratio-gosec:operations-manual:data-access/manage-policies/manage-domains-policies.adoc[domain policies] through _Stratio GoSec_.

== Transform your data

=== _Stratio Rocket_

After the data has been virtualized, you can access it from _Stratio Rocket_ using:

* The catalog.

* In the workflows using the input from xref:stratio-rocket:user-guide:workflow-asset/data-inputs.adoc#_stratio_virtualizer[_Stratio Virtualizer_].
+

TIP: For more detail on the _inputs/outputs_ it is recommended to visit the xref:stratio-rocket:user-guide:workflow-asset/data-inputs.adoc[_Stratio Rocket_ documentation].

=== _Stratio Intelligence_

You can see how the data is accessed from _Stratio Intelligence_ in the xref:ROOT:quick-start-guide.adoc#_stratio_intelligence[general quick start guide].
