In this section, you'll learn how to troubleshoot possible errors or problems related to Apache Impala® metadata discovery.

* If you use external tables, make sure that the columnar file is correctly encoded. You may have problems when querying data.
* Kerberos is a delicate mechanism. Make sure you have a direct connection to the server. Make sure that the secret is correct.
* If your account is a domain service account, be sure to link that domain to the realm, in the 'domain++_++realm' section. If it isn't, you don't need to do anything.
* You may have connection problems if the user permissions on the connection database are not set correctly.
* When in doubt, restart any service to apply the changes directly.
