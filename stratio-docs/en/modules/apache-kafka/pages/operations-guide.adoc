== Description

The SSCC Apache Kafka速 connector allows you to integrate https://kafka.apache.org/[Apache Kafka速] into _Stratio Rocket_.

=== Authentication

Currently, the connector only supports *TLS* authentication.

You will have to configure _Stratio Rocket_ with its corresponding values.

== Prerequisites

. The xref:ROOT:quick-start-guide.adoc[_Stratio KMS_ UI] should be accessible to manage credentials.
. Have an Apache Kafka速 queue configured with a host and a port.
. Create secrets in _Stratio KMS_. To connect to Apache Kafka速 via TLS you need to add the CA certificate to the path: `ca-trust/certificates/<certificate_ca_name>`.
