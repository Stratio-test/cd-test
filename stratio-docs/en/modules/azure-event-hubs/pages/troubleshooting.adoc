== "AUTHENTICATION_FAILED Log" error

If you get the following error in the input/output of _Stratio Rocket_ _workflows_:

[source]
----
An error: (java.security.PrivilegedActionException: javax.security.sasl.SaslException: No OAuth Bearer tokens in Subject's private credentials
[Caused by java.io.IOException: No OAuth Bearer tokens in Subject's private credentials]) occurred when evaluating the SASL token received from the Kafka Broker.
Kafka Client will go to AUTHENTICATION_FAILED state.
----

Common causes are usually due to:

* *Authorization*: incorrect credentials. Azure Event Hubs cluster, consumer group or topic are not authorized.
* *Network*: you need connectivity to:
** https://login.microsoftonline.com to get the token.
** Azure Event Hubs brokers. For example: `connectors.servicebus.windows.net`.
