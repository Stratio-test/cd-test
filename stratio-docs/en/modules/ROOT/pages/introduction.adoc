= Introduction

A connector is composed of one or more artifacts that allow access to data from external sources to the _Stratio Generative AI Fabric_ platform, so that the access of all modules of the platform to these external sources is fully integrated and transparent to the user.

The following image shows a schema of the different modules where the artifacts are used to connect to external data sources.

These artifacts have to be configured in each module. Later on, we'll cover how to specifically configure each external database that will be accessed.

== Managing secrets

All of the external connectors are integrated with _Stratio KMS_ (Key Management System), Stratio's centralized key management repository.

For each external database to be integrated, the secrets associated with the different modules that will use the external data must be uploaded to _Stratio KMS_:

* Discovery agent.
* _Stratio Virtualizer_.
* _Stratio Rocket_.
* _Stratio Rocket_ workflows.
* _Stratio Intelligence_.

Different types of secrets are supported depending on the database you want to connect to:

* MD5 (username/password).
* Kerberos integration with user/password authentication or keytab.
* Service accounts.
* Etc.

== Operation

In xref:stratio-virtualizer:architecture:features.adoc#_native_access_to_data_stores[__Stratio Virtualizer__] you can see the different operating modes.

== Supported data repositories

A compatibility matrix has been documented for each one of the repositories integrated into _Stratio Generative AI Data Fabric_, indicating:

* The versions of the repository used to certify connector integration.
* The versions of the driver used to certify connector integration.
* The link to the compatibility matrix of the manufacturer of the driver versions.

_Stratio Generative AI Data Fabric_ supports certified versions of the driver, as well as versions of the data repository for which the driver manufacturer guarantees compatibility.
