* The official versions of the MongoDB driver and the Apache Spark™ data source for MongoDB in their most recent versions are incompatible. This is because the Apache Spark™ data source, in turn, depends on the MongoDB driver, the latter having a lower version than the last one released. The connector is built on version 4.1.2 of the MongoDB driver and version 3.0.1 of the Apache Spark™ data source, both of which have been tested for compatibility.
