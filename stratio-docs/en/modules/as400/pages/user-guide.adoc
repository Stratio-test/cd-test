== Description

The SSCC AS400 connector allows you to fully integrate IBM Db2 iSeries AS400 into _Stratio Generative AI Data Fabric_.

Both the supported features and the different versions are found in the xref:oracle:compatibility-matrix.adoc[compatibility matrix].

== Discover your data

=== Know your data

In addition to what xref:stratio-data-governance:user-manual:from-a-data-store-to-a-dictionary.adoc#_tables_and_columns[_Stratio Data Governance_] shows, you can also find technical attributes extracted from AS400 resources. All metadata provided by AS400 is extracted and added to the _Stratio Data Governance_ UI in both tables and columns.

TIP: See https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.5?topic=overview-db2-i[Official IBM Db2 iSeries AS400 guide] for more information.

* The metadata extracted in table form are _tableType_, _insertable_, _typed_, _schema_ and _description_.
+

* The metadata extracted in column form are _type_, _nullable_, _ordinal_, _typedId_, and _properties_, which includes _description_.

=== BDL virtualization

The discovery process is asynchronous. Once completed, it can be viewed from the _Stratio Data Governance_ UI.

The connector supports customization of data access in virtualized tables using xref:stratio-data-governance:user-manual:bdl-virtualization.adoc#_bdl_custom_attributes[BDL custom attributes] from _Stratio Data Governance_. These can be modified from the UI.

* *bdl.options.virtualizer.native*: the possible values are "True" and "False". "True" if the user wants to access the data with the xref:stratio-virtualizer:user-guide:what-can-i-do-with-stratio-virtualizer.adoc#_native_queries[native queries] of _Stratio Virtualizer_. If this attribute is set, the default setting ("True") will be overwritten.
* *bdl.options.native.filter*: filter applied to the virtualization of the table if the data access mode is with the _Stratio Virtualizer_ native dialect.

NOTE: You can consult how to create attributes in the xref:stratio-data-governance:user-manual:addition-of-metadata[_Stratio Data Governance_ user guide].

TIP: For more details on the use of the BDL, see the xref:stratio-data-governance:user-manual:data-processing-with-bdl.adoc[BDL data processing documentation].

== Virtualize your data

After tables have been discovered, you can add them to a technical view of a collection. All the configurable parameters of the discovery and those parameters modified from the _Stratio Data Governance_ UI are propagated in the collections where that table is added.

TIP: To learn more about how to manage collections you can consult the xref:stratio-data-governance:user-manual:collections.adoc[_Stratio Data Governance_ user guide].

IMPORTANT: Note that to virtualize the discovered tables, you need to manage the xref:stratio-gosec:operations-manual:data-access/manage-policies/manage-domains-policies.adoc[domain policies] through _Stratio GoSec_.

To create a table directly in the _Stratio Virtualizer_ catalog, you can execute the following statement:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE as400_table USING jdbc OPTIONS (
  `stratiosecurity` 'true',
  `stratiosecuritymode` 'custom_sscc',
  `stratiocredentials` '<secret-name>',
  `stratiossccdriver` 'com.stratio.connectors.ssccas400.As400DriverMD5',
  `driver` 'com.ibm.as400.access.AS400JDBCDriver',
  `url` 'jdbc:as400://<host>:<port>/<schema_name>;prompt=false;naming=sql;errors=full;',
  `dbtable` '<schema_name>.<table_name>'
)
----

== Transform your data

=== _Stratio Rocket_

After the data has been virtualized, you can access it from _Stratio Rocket_ using:

* The catalog.
+
image::as400-vista-catalogo.png[]

* In the workflows using the input from xref:stratio-rocket:user-guide:workflow-asset/data-inputs.adoc#_stratio_virtualizer[_Stratio Virtualizer_]. You can force access through the native dialect by checking the "Force query execution with native connectors" box.
+
image::as400-vista-worflow-crossdata.png[Workflow]

IMPORTANT: When using the *_legacy_ mode*, the `lineageMode` variable must be set to "legacy" in the _workflows_ for the old functionalities to work correctly (i.e. quality rules and lineage).

=== _Stratio Intelligence_

You can see how the data is accessed from _Stratio Intelligence_ in the xref:ROOT:quick-start-guide.adoc#_stratio_intelligence[general quick start guide].
