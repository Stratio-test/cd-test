= Quick start guide

The purpose of this guide is to briefly explain how to integrate an IBM Db2 iSeries AS400 database into the _Stratio Generative AI Data Fabric_ platform.

== Prerequisites

You can find the prerequisites for installing the SSCC AS400 connector in the xref:as400:operations-guide.adoc#_prerequisites[operations guide].

== Discover your data

=== Discovery agent

To install a _Stratio Data Governance_ discovery agent for IBM Db2 iSeries AS400, select "AS400 Agent" in '_Stratio Command Center_' -> 'Deploy a Service' -> 'Connectors RDBMS'.

When installing, you need to add the URL of the connectors repository where the `sscc-postgresql-0.3_2.12-1.1.x` artifact is stored and upload the access credentials to _Stratio KMS_.

The most important fields to fill in are:

* *_Root discovery path_*: path from which you want to discover the metadata recursively.
* *_Custom Service URL_*: JDBC URL used to connect to AS400. Example: `jdbc:as400://your.host.com/-db-;prompt=false;`. The end of the string must contain the `/-db-` suffix.
* *_Access credentials_*: name of the secret created in _Stratio KMS_. For example: `as400-secret`.
* *_SSCC driver location_*: URL where the artifact that will contain the JAR of the SSCC AS400 connector is located in the connectors repository. Example: `http://connectors.<tenant>-<namespace>/v1/api/artifact/sscc-db2-0.3_2.12-1.4.x.jar`.
* *_JDBC driver location_*: URL where the artifact that will contain the JAR of the selected JDBC driver is located in the connectors repository. Example: `http://connectors.<tenant>-<namespace>/v1/api/artifact/jt400-11.1.jar`.

TIP: More information on the other configuration parameters can be found in the xref:as400:operations-guide.adoc[operations guide].

Once the discovery process is completed, the data store will appear in the _Stratio Data Governance_ UI.

== Virtualize your data

=== Eureka agent

To use the BDL, you need to configure the Eureka agent with the SSCC AS400 connector. To do this, simply add the URL of the connectors repository in the 'Customized deployment' -> 'Settings' -> `Additional jars` variable.

In the example being followed, the Eureka agent looks like this:

* _Additional jars_: *http://connectors.<tenant>-<namespace>/v1/api/artifact/sscc-db2-0.3_2.12-1.4.x.jar*.

NOTE: Remember that, if you already have more than one artifact in the list, you have to add the following ones, separating them with a comma.

=== _Stratio Virtualizer_

To use _Stratio Virtualizer_, the SSCC AS400 connector needs to be configured. To do so, you need to add the URL of the artifacts in the 'Customized deployment' -> 'Environment' -> 'External datastores' -> `JDBC Drivers URL List` variable and also xref:as400:operations-guide.adoc[upload the access credentials to _Stratio KMS_].

In the example being followed, _Stratio Virtualizer_ would look like this:

* _JDBC Drivers URL List_: *http://connectors.<tenant>-<namespace>/v1/api/artifact/sscc-db2-0.3_2.12-1.4.x.jar,http://connectors.<tenant>-<namespace>/v1/api/artifact/jt400-11.1.jar*.

== Transform your data

=== _Stratio Rocket_

To use _Stratio Rocket_, the SSCC AS400 connector needs to be configured. To do this, you must add the URL of the artifact in the 'Customized deployment' -> 'Settings' -> 'Classpath' -> `Rocket extra jars` variable and also upload the access credentials for the workflows and for _Stratio Rocket_ to _Stratio KMS_.

In the example being followed, _Stratio Rocket_ would look like this:

* 'Rocket extra jars': *http://connectors.<tenant>-<namespace>/v1/api/artifact/sscc-db2-0.3_2.12-1.4.x.jar,http://connectors.<tenant>-<namespace>/v1/api/artifact/jt400-11.1.jar*.
* 'Spark classpath extra jars': *http://connectors.<tenant>-<namespace>/v1/api/artifact/jt400-11.1.jar*.

After applying these changes, you should be able to access the virtualized collection of the SSCC AS400 connector via SQL queries directly in the catalog or via a _Stratio Virtualizer_ entry in a _workflow_.

TIP: More information on the other configuration parameters can be found in the xref:as400:operations-guide.adoc#rocket-configuration[operations guide].

=== _Stratio Intelligence_

You'll need to configure _Stratio Intelligence_ before integrating with the connector. For this, visit the xref:ROOT:quick-start-guide#_stratio_intelligence[_Stratio Intelligence_] section of the general quick start guide.

Once you've configured _Stratio Intelligence_, you have to add the IBM DB2 iSeries AS400 connector and the JDBC driver to the _artifacts/spark++_++jars_ directory and xref:as400:operations-guide.adoc[upload the access credentials to _Stratio KMS_].

You can download the necessary artifact to the _artifacts/spark++_++jars_ directory in the _Stratio Intelligence_ workspace by issuing a cURL request. In this case, you could make the following request:

[source,bash]
----
curl http://connectors.<tenant>-<namespace>/v1/api/artifact/sscc-db2-0.3_2.12-1.4.x.jar --output sscc-db2-0.3_2.12-1.4.x.jar
curl http://connectors.<tenant>-<namespace>/v1/api/artifact/jt400-11.1.jar --output jt400-11.1.jar
----

The following image shows how it is stored in the folder:

image::as400-intelligence-packages.png[BDL]

Once this configuration is done, you'll be able to access the tables that have been virtualized from the external IBM Db2 iSeries AS400 database.

Restart the PySpark kernel.
