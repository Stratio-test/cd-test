= Quick start guide

The purpose of this guide is to briefly explain how to integrate a Oracle database into the _Stratio Generative AI Data Fabric_ platform.

== Prerequisites

You can find the prerequisites for installing the SSCC Oracle connector in the xref:oracle:operations-guide.adoc#_prerequisites[operations guide].

NOTE: Please note that the *Kerberos authentication mode* will be used in this quick start guide.

== Discover your data

=== Discovery agent

To install a _Stratio Data Governance_ discovery agent for Oracle you must select "Oracle Agent" in '_Stratio Command Center_' -> 'Deploy a Service' -> 'Connectors RDBMS'.

When installing, you have to add the information corresponding to the database instance to be discovered, in addition to the URLs of the connectors repository where the necessary artifacts are stored and upload the access credentials to _Stratio KMS_.

The most important fields to fill in are:

* *_Root discovery path_*: path from which you want to discover the metadata recursively.
* *_Custom Service URL_*: JDBC URL used to connect to Oracle. Example: `jdbc:oracle:thin:@oracle.stratio.com:1921/-db-`.
* *_Access credentials_*: name of the secret created in _Stratio KMS_. Example: `oracle-secret`.
* *_SSCC driver location_*: URL where the artifact that will contain the JAR of the SSCC Oracle connector is located in the connectors repository. Example: `http://connectors.<tenant>-<namespace>/v1/api/artifact/sscc-oracle-0.3_2.12-1.5.x.jar`.
* *_JDBC driver location_*: URL where the artifact that will contain the JAR of the selected JDBC driver is located in the connectors repository. Example: `http://connectors.<tenant>-<namespace>/v1/api/artifact/ojdbc8-21.7.0.0.jar`.

TIP: More information on the other configuration parameters can be found in the xref:oracle:operations-guide.adoc[operations guide].

Once the discovery process is completed, the data store will appear in the _Stratio Data Governance_ UI.

== Virtualize your data

=== Eureka agent

To use the BDL, you need to configure the Eureka agent with the Oracle connector. To do this, simply add the URL of the connectors repository of the `sscc-oracle-0.3_2.12-1.5.x` artifact in the 'Customized deployment' -> 'Settings' -> `Additional jars` variable.

NOTE: Remember that, if you already have more than one artifact in the list, you have to add the following ones, separating them with a comma.

=== _Stratio Virtualizer_

To use _Stratio Virtualizer_ you need to have the Oracle connector configured. To do so, you need to add the URL of the `sscc-oracle-0.3_2.12-1.5.x` artifact in the 'Customized deployment' -> 'Environment' -> 'External datastores' -> `JDBC Drivers URL List` variable and also upload the access credentials to _Stratio KMS_.

== Transform your data

=== _Stratio Rocket_

To use _Stratio Rocket_ you need to have the Oracle connector configured. To do this, you must add the URL of the `sscc-oracle-0.3_2.12-1.5.x` artifact in the 'Customized deployment' -> 'Settings' -> 'Classpath' -> `Rocket extra jars` variable and also upload the access credentials for workflows and for _Stratio Rocket_ to _Stratio KMS_.

* 'Customized deployment' -> 'Settings' -> 'Classpath' -> `Rocket extra jars`: `http://connectors.<tenant>-<namespace>/v1/api/artifact/sscc-oracle-0.3_2.12-1.5.x.jar,http://connectors.<tenant>-<namespace>/v1/api/artifact/ojdbc8.jar,http://connectors.<tenant>-<namespace>/v1/api/artifact/xmlparserv2_sans_jaxp_services-21.7.0.0.jar,http://connectors.<tenant>-<namespace>/v1/api/artifact/xdb-21.7.0.0.jar`.

TIP: More information on the other configuration parameters can be found in the xref:oracle:operations-guide.adoc#rocket-configuration[operations guide].

=== _Stratio Intelligence_

You'll need to configure _Stratio Intelligence_ before integrating with the connector. You need to add the following properties:

* `INTERPOLATED_ANALYTIC_ENV_CROSSDATA_CATALOG_SECRET_INSTANCE_NAME`: ${username}
* `ANALYTIC_ENV_VAULT_PATH`: "people".
* `ANALYTIC_ENV_REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE`: /opt/sds/stratio_analytic/security/ca-bundle.pem
* `ANALYTIC_ENV_HIDE_VAULT_TOKEN`: "false"

In addition, in the multiuser environment, you need to enable the "Allow artifact deployment" option and have the _artifacts_ value in the path.

Once you've configured _Stratio Intelligence_, you have to add the Oracle connector to the _artifacts/spark++_++jars_ directory and upload the credentials to _Stratio KMS_.

To upload the artifacts, you have to download them from *http://connectors.<tenant>-<namespace>/v1/api/artifact/sscc-oracle-0.3_2.12-1.5.x* and from *http://connectors.<tenant>-<namespace>/v1/api/artifact/ojdbc8-21.7.0.0.jar* to the _artifacts/spark++_++jars_ directory in the _Stratio Intelligence_ workspace by issuing a cURL request.

In this case, make the following request:

[source,bash]
----
curl http://connectors.<tenant>-<namespace>/v1/api/artifact/sscc-oracle-0.3_2.12-1.5.x --output sscc-oracle-0.3_2.12-1.5.x
curl http://connectors.<tenant>-<namespace>/v1/api/artifact/ojdbc8-21.7.0.0.jar --output ojdbc8-21.7.0.0.jar
----
