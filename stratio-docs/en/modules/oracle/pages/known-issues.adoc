* _Custom_ type support:
** If native mode and _custom_ type support is enabled in the discovery agent, it will not be possible to disable native mode using `bdl.options.virtualizer.native = false` for technical tables that have _custom_ types. If disabled, the table will not be synchronized by _Stratio Eureka_ in the catalog.
** Writing on tables with _custom_ types is not supported.
