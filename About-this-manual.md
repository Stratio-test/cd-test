This user manual includes a description of the main functions and capabilities provided by *Stratio Data Governance*, as well as the procedures a user with certain privileges (described a little low) needs to know to access and use it. You can make it more tangible with a use case that we will follow throughout the manual.

Its content is organized top-bottom, from the general concepts to start knowing *Stratio Data Governance* to the most specific elements and functions it provides, traversing step-by-step instructions for best using it. Though, you don't need to check the sections in an orderly manner, as at the beginning of each you will be situated in which part of the process you are. In the end, there is a [Terms and definitions section](Terms-and-definitions.md) that compiles the main concepts treated along with its pages.

[box type="info"]Please note this manual is based on <i>Stratio Data Governance</i> version 1.9, which is the last released version as part of the <i>Phoenix 10.1</i> release.[/box]

It is tightly recommended to start by reading the ​[Introduction to the data governance](An-introduction-to-the-data-governance.md)​ which, after a quick review about what data governance holds, explains, at a glance, the vision Stratio has about the semantic treatment of data and processes and how it plans to raise a fully-semantic enterprise world. It will give you a base to contextualize and better understand the procedures described later.

Finally, this manual doesn't have a detailed description of [*Stratio Augmented Data Fabric*](../Stratio-Augmented-Data-Fabric/Getting-started/What's-Stratio-Augmented-Data-Fabric.md), its security, or its architecture. It assumes that the reader has a basic knowledge of the platform and its workings in general terms. It also doesn’t include other guides oriented towards operators or developers, which are available at the Stratio official documentation.

## Prerequisites and assumptions

Even though having some technical background will help you understand the underlying database concepts and operations, the lack of it won't prevent you take advantage of *Stratio Data Governance* features. Business/data analyst profiles will find themselves perfectly comfortable with *Stratio Data Governance* and *Stratio Discovery* (a non-technical tool focused on data discovery and visualization) user interfaces and capabilities.

There are two prerequisites we assume to be satisfied before proceeding with the manual:

  * A *Stratio Data Governance* installation up and running.
  * A valid user with permissions to log in.
